# microsoft-translator-extension

The Microsoft Translator extension, is a Chromium-compatible extension that improves the design of the Microsoft Bing Translator site.

## Download
This extension was created for all Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera...), but we do not support all these browsers. Indeed the extension is downloadable and installable manually for all browsers, but as part of the installation by application store, this is only available with Opera. Support for Google Chrome should arrive very soon.
